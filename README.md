# Research Objective:
In this paper, we present an architecture by integrating the Next Generation 5G network with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) using the concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN). MEC uses the approach of forming small nodes or clusters of smart vehicles based upon their location over the edge of the network. As a result, the communication overheads using VANETs can be resolved by increasing the throughput. We also provide examples providing proof how reliable V2V communications are even how to measure the reliability of the communication of messages especially with the decentralized platoon of vehicles communicating and even predict the crashes before the collision.
